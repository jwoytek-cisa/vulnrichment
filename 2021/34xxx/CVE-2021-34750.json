The attacker would require low privilege credentials on an affected device.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to lack of proper encryption of sensitive information stored within the GUI configuration manager. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging into the FMC GUI and navigating to certain sensitive configurations. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive configuration parameters in clear text.Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.[[Publication_URL{Layout()}]]This advisory is part of the October 2021 release of the Cisco&nbsp;ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.
