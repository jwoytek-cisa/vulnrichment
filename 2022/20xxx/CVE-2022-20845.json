          "value": "A vulnerability in the TL1 function of Cisco&nbsp;Network Convergence System (NCS) 4000 Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a memory leak in the TL1 process.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to TL1 not freeing memory under some conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the device and issuing TL1 commands after being authenticated. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the TL1 process to consume large amounts of memory. When the memory reaches a threshold, the Resource Monitor (Resmon)&nbsp;process will begin to restart or shutdown the top five consumers of memory, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This advisory is part of the September 2022 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
